# AWS Examples

Welcome to the AWS section of our Cloud Provider Examples Repository! Here, you'll find a collection of templates, scripts, and configurations specifically for Amazon Web Services (AWS). Whether you're automating EC2 instances, setting up RDS databases, or configuring S3 buckets, this is the place to share your knowledge and learn from others.

## Contributing

We encourage contributions of all forms. To add your AWS example, please:

1. **Ensure Uniqueness:** Check existing examples to avoid duplication.
2. **Create a New Directory:** For your example under the `aws/` directory. The directory name should briefly describe your example.
3. **Include a README:** Each example must have its own README.md explaining what it does, the AWS services used, deployment steps, and any prerequisites.

## Example Structure

- `/aws/your-example-name/`
  - `README.md`
  - `template.yaml`
  - `script.sh`

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository.
2. Add your example in the `aws/` directory following the guidelines.
3. Submit a pull request with a brief description of your example.

Thank you for contributing and helping the cloud community!
